Indrek has created a number of incredible videos dealing with the Arduino, including his ArduSpreadsheet for logging data in Excel. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any means of contacting him.

The ArduSpreadsheet only works with Arduino IDE 1.x.x.
It would be great for a port to 2.2.1.

ArduSpreadsheet is licensed under GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, so it seems modifications are permissible.

Please help, or better yet provide means of contacting Indrek.
